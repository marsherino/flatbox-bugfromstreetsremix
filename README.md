This repository contains 3D-printable models and the PCB design files needed to make an arcade controller that looks like this:

[INSERT COMPLETED PICTURE HERE]

There are two versions of this Flatbox fork: one based on the architecture of the Flatbox rev4 (embedded RP2040 chip), and the other based on the Flatbox rev5 (Waveshare RP2040-Zero), both by jfedor2. 

Please see the READMEs for each version for instructions on component purchasing and assembly.

Both controllers run on [GP2040-CE firmware](https://gp2040-ce.info/) developed by the Open Stick Community and use Kailh low profile Choc v1 keyboard switches for both movement and action buttons.

Both controllers have five input modes: XInput, Nintendo Switch, PS3, PS4, and keyboard.

The table below lists each version's specifications.
