# Flatbox, Bug from Streetsâ„¢ Remix: a low profile, low cost leverless arcade controller with thumb action button and simplified fourth row.

This repository contains 3D-printable models and the PCB design files needed to make an arcade controller that looks like this:

[INSERT COMPLETED PICTURE HERE]

There are two versions of this Flatbox fork: one based on the architecture of the Flatbox rev4 (embedded RP2040 chip), and the other based on the Flatbox rev5 (Waveshare RP2040-Zero), both by jfedor2. 

Please see the READMEs for each version for instructions on component purchasing and assembly.

Both controllers run on GP2040-CE firmware developed by the Open Stick Community (https://gp2040-ce.info/#/download) and use Kailh low profile Choc v1 keyboard switches for both movement and action buttons.

The table below lists their main features. See the README for each version for details on how to make them.
