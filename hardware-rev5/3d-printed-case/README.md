This folder includes several versions of the .stl files needed to make a 3D printed case for the Flatbox rev5 - Bug from Streetsâ„¢ Remix. 

The normal version replicates the dimensions of the original Flatbox case and was designed by me, based on the original file by jfedor2. 

The extra-wide version was kindly provided by lethalmonk6, and is approximately 245mm wide (with length and height remaining the same.) The extra-wide version requires 9 screws to secure the case instead of 7, though with the pcb files provided here, the leftmost two screws will not mount into the pcb. 

Whichever version of the case you print, make sure that you use the top and bottom parts of the same version. Both parts will be in the corresponding folder.

The case should be printed at a 0.20mm layer height and a 15-20% infill. The bottom part should be printed as oriented in the .stl; the top part should be printed upside-down. When printed in this orientation, you won't need supports to print any part of the case.

The button .stl files available here are jfedor's original button design. I recommend SGF Devices's revised Bridget buttons for the Choc v1, which are sturdier, and are available [here](https://github.com/sgfdevices/Bridget/tree/main/Buttons/deprecated%20versions/v1%20stems). There are a number of other alternate designs for the button caps that, for example, print the stems as separate pieces to be glued into the tops or model the housing differently; I encourage you to do your research and find a cap design that works for you. The buttons should be printed upside-down, and will not need supports.

If you do not own a 3D printer, you may find it easier to get a set of buttons printed in MJF Nylon by JLCPCB when you order your boards. The files can be found in the "MJF (Nylon) Button Sprues" subfolder in the "Buttons" folder above, and were also designed and kindly provided by lethalmonk6.

You will need 9 small buttons (24mm) and 3 large buttons (30mm) for this remix.

If you want to make your own revision of the case, the .step file is available in the "Extras" folder. You will need some form of CAD software (I use Fusion 360) to modify it. If you design a case revision that you think others might enjoy, feel free to get in touch with me and we can discuss hosting it on this repo.
